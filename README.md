# MSGARCH_Algo
MS-GARCH-based Bitcoin trading and hedging strategy using regime detection and Telser's criterion.

This project extends my master's thesis on the application of Markov Switching GARCH models in algorithmic trading. It focuses on developing a volatility-regime-based trading and hedging strategy for Bitcoin.

## Features
- Regime identification using MS-GARCH (high vs. low volatility)
- Rolling window analysis for out-of-sample performance
- Strategy evaluation using Telser’s safety-first optimization criterion


## Tools

- `MSGARCH` package for model estimation
- Additional tools: `quantmod`, `xts`, `PerformanceAnalytics`

## Status
Work in progress – code to be finalized and published soon.
